- **Entities** represent any object or resource that you want to monitor. You can create an entity through the UI, API, or CLI for any server or website that you want to monitor. Entities can be servers or non-server objects, but most often entities refer to individual servers. As you create new cloud servers, cloud databases, or dedicated devices, entities are created automatically. For more information, see the API operations reference for the [entities resource](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#entities-operations).
- **Checks** specify the parts or pieces of the entity for which you want to collect metrics on and how you want to do it. In other words, a check returns a group of related metrics. Checks of different types return different sets of metrics, which help you figure out how to collect the data you want. For a complete list of check types, see the [Check typs documentation](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-tech-ref-info/check-type-reference).
- **Alarms**  contain the rules that determine the state of an alarm as OK, WARNING or CRITICAL. The state change of an alarm will trigger an alert. For details of the alarm, see [Alert Triggering and Alarms](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-tech-ref-info/alert-triggers-and-alarms).
- **Notifications** and **Notification** plans describe how Rackspace Monitoring sends alerts to you when an alarm state changes.
    - Each  notification specifies two things: to whom the alert should be sent (the target) and how it should be delivered (the type). For a complete list of notification types see [Notification types](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/notification-type-operations).
    - A notification plan is a group of notifications used by alarms.
