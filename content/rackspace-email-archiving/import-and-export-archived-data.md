You can import data into and export data from your archive in Cloud
Office.

### Prerequisites

- **Applies to:** Administrator
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Time needed:** Dependent of amount of data being exported or imported
- **Tools required:**  Cloud Office Control Panel access

For more information on prerequisite terminology, see [Cloud Office support terminology](/how-to/cloud-office-support-terminology).

Cost and turnaround time both depend on how much data you want to
recover.

### Exporting data

You can use the following methods to export your data from your
Rackspace Archiving account:

-   Export your data from the Archive Manager by creating searches and
    exporting the results of the searches. For information about how to
    export the results of a search, see [Export archive search results
    in Cloud Office](/how-to/export-archive-search-results-in-cloud-office).

    **Note:** You can export searches with a maximum of 15,000
results and a total size of 3.5 GB.

-   If you require a bulk export of your archived data, our support team can
    perform the export and provide you with links from which you can
    download your data directly.

The pricing for a bulk export is a one-time fee.

|Export Format| Price per GB|
|---|---|
|EML| $6 per GB|
|PST| $9 per GB|


When determining which export method to use, consider the following
questions.

**Is an external third party requesting these exports?**

Providing a [temporary login](/how-to/add-and-edit-archive-users-in-cloud-office/) for third parties to review search results
is much faster than requesting a bulk export.

**To which format do you need to export?**

We offer bulk exports in either PST or EML format. Although PST is a
more well-known format, exporting in EML tends to be easier to search,
faster for us to produce, and much cheaper. We recommend that you first
determine whether there is a preferred format. If there is no preferred
format, then we recommend using EML.

**Do you need to export all data or only data that meets certain criteria?**

In most cases, more data means a longer and more expensive export if requesting a bulk export from support. If you are looking to export specific items such as messages from a particular sender, or message delivered within a specific time frame, exporting search results is a more efficient option. For information about how to export the results of a search, see [Export archive search results in Cloud
Office](/how-to/export-archive-search-results-in-cloud-office).


### Time frames for importing and exporting data ###

Following are the *estimated maximum* completion times for both importing and
exporting data:

-  Less than 25 GB in 2 weeks.
-  25 GB to 49 GB in 3 weeks.
-  50 GB to 99 GB in 4 weeks.
-  100 GB to 1 TB in 6 weeks.
-  If you have over 1 TB of data, contact Rackspace for an estimate.

**Note:** The preceding information gives rough estimates and should not be considered a commitment or a service level agreement (SLA).
