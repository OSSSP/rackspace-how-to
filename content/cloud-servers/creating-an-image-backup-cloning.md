This article guides you through the process of creating an image backup (cloning).

While you can create a different size server from that of the saved image, you must still use the same base OS
version.

The first part of the procedure takes you through creating a snapshot image; if your snapshot image has already
been created, you can skip to Restoring a Server from a saved image.

1. Log into the [Cloud Control Panel](http://mycloud.rackspace.com).

2. Select the server that you want to clone by clicking the actions cog
to the left of the server name. From the drop-down menu, click **Create Image**.

   A pop-up window will appear that allows you to name the image.

3. After naming the image, click **Create Image**.

Server images will appear in the **Images** list after they have been created. They can be accessed by clicking on the **View Images** in the **Images** section.
