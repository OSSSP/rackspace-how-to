This article provides a closer look at the services available on
the **Account Settings** and **User Management** pages in the Cloud
Control Panel. You access these pages from the user name menu located
in the top-right corner of the control panel.

### Account Settings page

Use the Account Settings page to view or adjust login details, contact
information for the primary contact on your account, and time zone
preferences.

-   Use the **Login Details** section to update your password, email
    address, and security question, and to enable multi-factor authentication for the account. Your username is set at the time that
    you create your account and cannot be changed. To use a different
    username, you must close the account and create a new one. Each
    account has only one username, and there are no subaccounts. If you
    have multiple team members who need to access the Rackspace Cloud
    account, you must add each one as a member on the **User
    Management** page.

    Your API key is a unique alphanumeric identifier associated with
    your account. You can use the API key to manage your assets through
    a scripting interface. You can view, copy, or reset your API key in
    the **Login Details** section.

-   In the **Contact Information** section, pay special attention to the
    information that you have set for the primary contact. The primary
    contact is the person who is authorized to make service requests,
    and the specified email address is the only one that is contacted
    when a service-impacting event occurs. Ensure that the address for
    the primary contact is set up to receive critical information and is
    monitored 24 hours a day.

-   If you enable multi-factor authentication for the account, you can require that other users of the account use multi-factor authentication, in the **Account-Wide Settings** section. For more information, see [Multi-factor authentication from the Cloud Control Panel](/how-to/multi-factor-authentication-from-the-cloud-control-panel).     

-   Select your local time zone in the **Preferences** section.

### User Management page

Use the **User Management** page to edit user-related information, such
as email addresses and passwords, and to add new users.

-   To make changes for a user, click the gear icon next the user name
    and select one of the options. Complete the
    applicable fields in the resulting pop-up dialog box and save
    the changes.

-   To add a new user, click **Create User**. On the **Create
    User** page, enter information for the new user's login, access
    levels, and contact information. For information about access
    controls for new users, see [Learning about Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/how-to/overview-role-based-access-control-rbac).
    After you have entered all of the information for the new user,
    click the **Create User** button at the bottom of the page.
