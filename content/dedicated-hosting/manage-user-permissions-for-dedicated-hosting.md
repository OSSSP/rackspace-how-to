This article explains user permissions for Dedicated Hosting and shows you how
to manage these permissions.

You manage permissions in the [MyRackspace
portal](https://login.rackspace.com) under **Account > Permissions**.

**Note**: To access the **Permissions** area in the MyRackspace portal and
modify another userâ€™s permission, you must have one of the following
permissions:

  - **Account Administrator**: This permission grants a user unlimited access
    to every section of the MyRackspace portal.

  - **Admin**: This permission (on a device or service) grants a user the
    ability to manage the device or service, as well as which users can access the device or service.

### Types of permissions

The following types of permissions are available for Dedicated Hosting
accounts:

- **Direct Permissions**: These permissions grant the user direct access to
  account permissions, cloud accounts, devices, or services.

- **Effective Permissions**: The permissions that a user inherits as a result
  of their memberships in User and Product Groups.

**Note**: You can grant a user a combination of direct and effective
permissions. MyRackspace adheres to the highest level of permission granted.

### How permissions impact the user experience for tickets

The following table shows the permissions that a user needs to perform common
tasks with tickets:

| **Task** 	| **Permission required** 	|
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|---------------------------------------------------	|
| View or include another user on an account ticket (a ticket that doesn't have a device or service associated with it) 	| **View Tickets** or **Edit Tickets** permission 	|
| View or include another user on a ticket that has a device associated with it | **View**, **Edit**, or **Admin** permission to that device 	|
| View or include another user on a ticket that has a service associated with it (such as tickets for Managed Antivirus)	| **View**, **Edit**, or **Admin** permission to that service 	|

The following table shows the ticketing settings that are required for commmon
actions or views:

| **Functionality** 	| **Ticketing setting** 	|
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|-------------------------------------------	|
| To enable users to be able to see tickets that include a device that they have permission to view. <br />For example, if a user has access to device A, they will see all of the tickets that include device A even if another device is on the ticket.<br /> If device C is later added to the ticket and the user does not have access to device C, the user will still be able to see the ticket. 	| Flexible Ticket Viewing (Default Setting) 	|
| To require Users to have access to all of the devices on a ticket in order to see that ticket. <br /> For example, if a ticket includes device A and device B, then the User must have permissions to both devices to see the ticket.<br /> If device C is later added to the ticket and the user does not have access to device C, the user is no longer be able to see the ticket. 	| Strict Ticket Viewing 	|
