### How permissions impact the user experience for tickets

| **Task** 	| **Permission required** 	|
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|---------------------------------------------------	|
| View or include another user on an account ticket (tickets that do not have devices or services associated to the ticket) 	| View Tickets and/or Edit Tickets permission 	|
| View or include another user on a ticket that has a device(s) associated 	| View, Edit or Admin permission to that device(s) 	|
| View or include another user on a ticket that has a service(s) associated (such as tickets for Managed Antivirus) 	| View, Edit or Admin permission to that service(s) 	|

### Types of permissions

The following permissions are available for Dedicated Hosting:

- **Direct Permissions**: Grants the user direct access to account
  permissions, cloud accounts, devices or services.

- **Effective Permissions**: Effective permissions are the permissions that a
  user has inherited as a result of their memberships in different User &
  Product Groups.

**Note**: You can grant a user a mixture of direct and effective (inherited)
permissions. MyRackspace adheres to the highest level of permission granted.
