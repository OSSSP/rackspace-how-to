###Spam management###
You can manage your spam settings at either the mailbox or domain level. You
can also manage your own blacklists and safelists (otherwise known as
whitelists).

###Domain and mailbox administration###
You can add and delete mailboxes for each of your domains, as well as disable
and enable mailboxes.  The control panel displays mailbox usage, so you can
monitor your mailboxes at a glance. You can also export information about all
your mailboxes or entire domains for local analysis.

###Management logins###
You can create and delete management logins for your team or your customers,
which gives you the flexibility to assign administrator permissions to all or
to specific lists of domains.  You can also enable or disable two-factor
authentication per user account.

You can restrict the limited administrator to specific tasks and abilities
as dictated by your business needs.
