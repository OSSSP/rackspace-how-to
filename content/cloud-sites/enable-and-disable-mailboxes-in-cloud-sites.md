**Important:** Disabling a mailbox prevents the user from logging into the mailbox. The mailbox still receives email, and forwarding rules still apply.

### Enable or disable a mailbox

1. Log in to the [Cloud Sites Email Control Panel](https://cloudsites.mycpsrvr.com/) using your username and password.

1. In the **Email Hosting** section, choose **Mailboxes**.

1. If you have multiple domains, select the appropriate domain name.

1. Click **Enable** or **Disable** to the right of the mailbox name.

### Enable or disable multiple mailboxes

1. When viewing the list of mailboxes, place a checkmark to the left of each email address that you would like to enable or disable.

1. Under the list of mailboxes, select either **Enable Mailboxes** or **Disable Mailboxes** from the **Select Action** dropdown.
