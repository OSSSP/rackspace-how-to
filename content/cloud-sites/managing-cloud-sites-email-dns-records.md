DNS records are like "phone books" for the Internet and can be very
useful when additional information is needed. They contain information
about every registered domain on the web, such as where email should be
sent and who is the domain's hosting provider. If you host your DNS with
Rackspace, you can manage your DNS records through the control panel.
Let's take a look at the following steps below to see how this is done.

1. Log in to your control panel at [cp.rackspace.com](http://cp.rackspace.com).

2. After you are logged in, mouse over the **Go to section** drop-down menu and
   select **Domains**.

3. In the **Manage** section, click **DNS Settings**.

4. Search for the domain for which you want to manage DNS settings and
   click **DNS Records**.

5. Choose between **Use Rackspace Name servers** or **Use Custom Name Servers**.
   By default, **Use Rackspace Name servers** will be chosen with entries
   already implemented for you. If you would like to use your own, choose
   **Use Custom Name Servers**. Make your changes as needed and then select
   **Save**.

    **Note:** **Use Rackspace Name Servers** must be selected for the Hosting 
    and Mail Records sections to be visible. To add additional DNS records,
    click the **Add Additional Record** button.
