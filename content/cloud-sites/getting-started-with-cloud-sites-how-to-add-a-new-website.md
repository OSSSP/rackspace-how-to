**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

### Previous section

[Cloud Sites introduction](/how-to/cloud-sites)

This article will show you how to create your domain through the [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com).

1. Log in to the [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com).

2. Navigate to **Hosting > Cloud Sites**

3. Click **Add A Site**.


4. For the pop-up menu that opens, enter who the website will be for and
   your new domain name, and the click **Add New Site**.

5.  Depending on the domain name you are trying to add, you are presented
    with one out of three different screens.
    - Register your new domain name
    - Pick a different domain name
    - Domain name cannot be automatically registered or transferred

Each of the options is explained as follows:

### Register new domain name

-   If the domain name is available, you must register the domain name.
    You also have the option to choose the domain name without registering it.

    **Note:** If you choose not to register your domain name, it will not be accessible for pubic viewing on the Internet.

-   Once you have made your selection, click **Next Step** to proceed

### Domain name already exists

If you get the message that the domain is already taken, this means that
someone has already set up this domain name on the Rackspace Cloud and it
cannot be duplicated in our system. Enter a different domain name
in the box below *Domain Name* and click **Continue** to proceed.

### Domain cannot be automatically registered Or transferred

If you get the message that *the domain cannot be automatically
registered or transferred*, this means that the domain has **already
been registered** and is not currently available to be transferred to
the Rackspace Cloud. If you are the owner of the domain do not worry,
**you can still proceed** with adding the domain to the Rackspace Cloud
by clicking **Continue**.

-   Proceed by selecting *"I already own this domain"*,
    and then click on **Next Step**

The only steps left are to choose your website's default technology and
any additional features you may need such as a database.

-   The next page  offers 3 different options. The first option allows
    you to add Microsoft SQL Server Storage space.

-   Below that, you will be able to choose a number of Databases you
    would like.

-   In the last section, choose your website's default technology.
    For an extensive breakdown on the available technology in Cloud Sites, see
    the [Cloud Sites product page](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/sites/technology/).

-   Click **Next Step** to proceed once you have made your selections.

-   Review your order, and click **Finish** once you have verified 
    everything is correct. If you would like to make any changes to your
    new domain order, click **Back**

**Note:** You may incur charges depending on whether you are
registering or transferring a domain to the Rackspace Cloud. You may
also incur additional charges if you have chosen to add Microsoft SQL
Storage Space to your new website. Please use this review screen to
ensure your order is accurate before choosing Finish to begin
provisioning your new website. If you would like to view our current
price guide for registering, transferring domains, or adding additional
